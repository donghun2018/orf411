For your convenience, the ZIP file of the codes can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/donghun2018/orf411/archive/master.zip).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the Python codes and set up your local machine to run the codes.

### Prerequisites

This software was tested with Python 3.6.

#### Python

We recommend Anaconda as an easy way to get a working python system in your machine.
Get it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

The code is developed and tested on 64-bit python 3.6.

#### Packages

The packages required by the code are:

- numpy: used for pseudorandom number generator and many useful functions
- scipy: used for more exotic functions that are not offered in numpy
- openpyxl: used for Microsoft Excel xlsx input/output functionalities

You may get these using conda

```
$ conda install numpy scipy openpyxl
```

or using pip (if you already have Python in your machine and decided not to use Anaconda)

```
$ pip install numpy openpyxl
```
