The code is developed and tested on 64-bit python 3.6.

#### Packages

The packages required by the code are:

- numpy: used for pseudorandom number generator and many useful functions
- scipy: used for more exotic functions that are not offered in numpy
- openpyxl: used for Microsoft Excel xlsx input/output functionalities

You may get these using conda

```
$ conda install numpy scipy openpyxl
```

or using pip (if you already have Python in your machine and decided not to use Anaconda)

```
$ pip install numpy scipy openpyxl
