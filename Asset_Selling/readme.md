Instructions to run the asset selling model package with different policies:

1. To run the asset selling model with a random policy, simply run AssetSellingModel.py as is. You will be able to see the output and can experiment with changing the value of the parameter (it is set at 0.8).

2. To run the asset selling model with other available policies (sell-low, high-low and track policy), open AssetSellingPolicy.py, choose your desired policy by commenting out the other policies and run the code. Experiment with different policies and parameters.

3. To run a full-grid search over theta values in the policies (as in the problem set), modify the identical code for full-grid search in EnergyStoragePolicy.py.
